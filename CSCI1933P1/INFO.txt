3.  You will want to compile the FractalProgram class as that is where you will be
  running the program. You will do this by entering javac FractalProgram.java
  in your terminal, then you will enter java FractalProgram to run it.
  After running the file you will then be prompted to enter a shape to
  draw its fractal from the options given.

4. An assumption is that you enter the shape exactly how it is spelled when
  you are prompted the options. You must make sure it is spelled correctly
  and starts with a capital or else you will get a blank canvas.
  If you type anything else other than the options prompted you will also get a blank canvas.

5. A tiny feature that I have implemented is a random color function where each time
the fractal is drawn each and every shape will be initialized a random color.

6. There might be a bug where the fractal doesn't fully appear, or it might not look complete.
You will have to click on fullscreen and then click out for it to appear normally if this happens.

7. No outside sources were consulted
