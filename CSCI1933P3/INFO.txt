2. We essentially split the project I worked on doing all the methods for LinkedList
and Shareef decided to work with ArrayList while we also helped each other when needed.

3. No assumptions needed everything should run as it's supposed to.

4. Had a helper function in both ArrayList and LinkedList named isIn()
  that determined if an element existed in a list.

5. No known bugs or defects, all methods pass the J-Unit Tests.

6. No outside sources were used while working on this project.
