1. Hamza Ahmed (ahme0650), Shareef Oty (oty00003)

2. I did evaluateField(), revealZeros(), gameOver(), and both toString() and debug() since they were almost identical.
While Shareef did revealStartingArea(), and guess(), and createMines().
We both worked on the Main Implementation of the game and of course helped each other out when needed.

3. While playing the game whatever is prompted must follow the exact format or the game will stop working.
Any extra spaces or invalid inputs will crash the game unless told otherwise.

4. An addition to our project is a helper function inBounds() that took an array and indexes to determine if a coordinate was valid.
Also, we added a getter for the attribute flags that was used in main to keep track of the flags remaining.

5. One bug is that if you guess a mine it will print out that you lost twice but other than that no other known
bugs or defects. The game should work properly as long as input is inputted correctly.

6. Other than TA's no outside resources were used for this project.

7.I certify that the information contained in this INFO file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the
course policies in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
