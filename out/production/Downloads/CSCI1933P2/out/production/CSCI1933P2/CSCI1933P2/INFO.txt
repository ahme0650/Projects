2. No Partner Was All Done By Me

3. When you run the game you must write whatever is prompted exactly as is.
    When asked to make your move you must put indexes than are not out of range or the game will crash(so 0 - 7)
    Also you must not type anything else other than numbers in the exact format or the game will crash (x x x x - where x are numbers)

4. I have a helper function in board named winner() where it checks what color of king is left on the board
    after the game has ended and prints out who has won.

5. No known bugs or defects.

6. No outside sources were used while making this project.

7. I have both read and followed the course policies in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
   Signed - Hamza Ahmed.
